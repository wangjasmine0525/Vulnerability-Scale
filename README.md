# Vulnerability-Scale

For Data Science Society's 2nd Annual Datathon for Social Good, my teammates and I created the Vulnerability Scale: a system that gives a standardized vulnerability score measuring a county's relative demand for resources during health crises like COVID-19. We analyzed US Census Bureau data on age, income, population density and rate of health insurance by county and visualized our findings on a dynamic geospatial map using Tableau. We ended up placing 3rd taking the title of "Most Creative".
